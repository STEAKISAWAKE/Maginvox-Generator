# Maginvox-Generator
A test generator to show how to easily create your own generators for maginvox.

# Marching Cubes
**If you do not know what marching cubes is, you cannot create a generator. No buts about it.**

Marching cubes is a computer graphics algorithm, published in the 1987 SIGGRAPH proceedings by Lorensen and Cline, for extracting a polygonal mesh of an isosurface from a three-dimensional discrete scalar field.

Is the Definition from google but that doesn't explain much.

Marching cubes is in the most basic explaination
A point in 3d space with a value attached, that value is then used to find how its verticies should be placed.

tldr; Points in space have a value
